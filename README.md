# Capstone Project
Visitors Guide for The Magic City Discovery Center (a local children's museum) an iOS application

## Background:
This capstone project was chosen to encompass the full lifecycle of mobile app development. I dedicated significant time to learning Ui/Ux development tools, including Figma, to create interactive prototypes and supportthe design process with well-documented, clearly commented amterials.

This documentation includes links and screenshots from the initial development phases, design iterations, and the overall development process. The primary goal was to gain hands-on experience with project planning, Ui/Ux design, and full-stack mobile app development.

## Teck Stack:
- Xcode
- Swift
- SwiftUI / UIkit
- Firebase ??

## Figma Design File
Honestly, this is kinda sad, I mean it is pretty decent for my first attempt.... but I could do better...
